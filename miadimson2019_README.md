#Mia Dimson's README

##Description:

This project is intended to help teachers and students create goals to help with workflow and getting work done. My part of the project consists of merging the back end to the front end.

Students and teacher can create goals for themselves and delete goals thus far.


##Tasks to do:

What needs to be done next is to make sure that students and teachers can see their individual goals that they have set for themselves or their students. 

Teachers also need to be able to see the progress their students have made on the goals.

Teachers must be able to assign students certain goals and should be able to see the goals that the students have created for themselves.
