##Olivea Varady's README

##Description:

This project is intended to help teachers and students create goals to help with workflow and getting work done.

My part of the project was to design the front end. So far, the website is fully designed but not functional.

##How to run the program:

###Front End:
To run the front end, run `cd version_control/`
Next, run `cd Goal-Management-System`
Then, run `cd Front-End/`
Finally, run `ng serve`

##Tasks To-Do:
Currently, the header thinks the page is collapsed, so you need to make the header expand across the whole top of the page.

If we want Chadwick to use this website, we need to make the page full functional. You must merge with backend to see what is functional and what is not.
