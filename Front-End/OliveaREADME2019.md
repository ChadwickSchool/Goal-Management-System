## Olivea Varady's README

## Description:

This project is intended to help teachers and students create goals to help with workflow and getting work done.

My part of the project was to design the front end. So far, the website is fully designed but not functional.

## How to run the program:

### Front End:
To run the front end, run `cd version_control/`

Next, run `cd Goal-Management-System`

Then, run `cd Front-End/`

Finally, run `ng serve`

## Components:

HeaderComponent:

The HeaderComponent is the navbar that is located at the top of the website. The navbar consists of many components which allows one to navigate to different web pages. The HeaderComponent is in charge of separating the Teacher Components from the Student Components. To access the student website, click on the header component and then click on the file labeled header.component.ts. Once in the file, set the "is teacher" to true. To access the teacher website, repeat the same steps above, but set "is teacher" to false. 

### Teacher Components:

### Student Components:

## Tasks To-Do:
Currently, the header thinks the page is collapsed, so you need to make the header expand across the whole top of the page.

If we want Chadwick to use this website, we need to make the page fully functional. You must merge with backend to see what is functional and what is not.
